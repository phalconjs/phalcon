# Deploy Nodejs app on Google App Engine

## Introduction.

**TL;DR;** In this article we are going to deploy a Nodejs app on Google App Engine. 
We are going to. This is going to be a step by step demonsatration starting from setting up our Google App Engine environment to deploying our Nodejs app on it.

## What is Google App Engine?

GAE, a PaaS cloud-computing platform released by Google on 7th April, 2008 is written in C++, PHP, Nodejs, and Python. GAE provides an ideal environment for developers or orgs to host their applications without thinking of the infarastructure, downtime, scaling to billion users. GAE provides all of these, in truth, you need not to worry about the server, just deploy and GAE will handle everything. GAE will automatically scale and allocate more resources to your app when requests and demand are huge.

Google App Engine is a cloud runtime environment that allows you to easily deploy and run standard web apps. GAE provides the monitoring, scaling and load balancing infrastructure, so you can focus on building your web apps.


## Create Google App Engine Instance (**2nd Generation Instance**).

To start using GAE we are going to setup a GCP project:

1. Sign in to your Google account. Sign up, if don't alreday have one.
1. Go to [AppEngine](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/projectselector/create?lang=nodejs&st=true)
1. Click on "Use the app" or "Not now"
1. On the screen that shows up, click "select" or "create".
1. Type your project name on the "Project name" textfield, below the textfiled will be your projcetID generated by GCP based on your Projcet name. click on ok when done.
1. After few seconds of waiting, a screen shows up to "Select a location". On the "Select a region" dropdown widget, click on it to select your preferred region, then click on "Next"
1. Next screen shows up to "Enable billng". Click on "Set up billing"
1. A modal shows up, click on "Create billing account"

## Installing the Google Cloud tools (Cloud SDK).

Google Cloud tools is a bag full of utilities all very useful in setting up and accessing Google Cloud products: Google Kubernetes, Google App Engine, Google Big Query from your terminal. To begin installing the Cloud SDK, go to [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts), and download the SDK installer for your OS. 

Google Cloud SDK contains tools like `gcloud`, and `gsutil`, but we will be using the `gcloud` tool to initialize and deploy our app.

The gcloud tool contain various commands to enable perfomrm different actions on our GCP:

* **gcloud info**:
* **gcloud auth list**:
* **gcloud init**:
* **gcloud info**:
* **gcloud config list**

Ok, we have digressed a little bit, lets come back to what we have in hand, after downloading the Cloud SDK instaler, launch the installer and follow the prompts, make sure you check relevant optins presented. After the installation has completed the installer will launch the command `gcloud init` in a terminal window.


## Setup our Nodejs app.
## Create API endpoints (**Black Panther API**).
## Add mLab datastore to our API endpoints.
## Test our app locally via **cURL**.
## Deploy our app.
## Test our deployed app (**cURL**).
## Conclusion.
